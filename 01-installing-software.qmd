# Installing and setting up tools {#sec-install-tools}

Following are the steps to installing R, RStudio, and Git depending on your operationg system.

## Installing R, RStudio, and git {#sec-install-r}

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Windows {#sec-setup-windows}

### Step 1: Download and install R {#sec-install-r-windows .unnumbered}

Important that R is installed first. R is the main software and is needed for RStudio to work properly. R should always be installed first.

Go to [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and click on the link that says ***Download R for Windows***. In the following page, click on the link that says ***install R for the first time***.

Then click on ***Download R-4.X.X for Windows*** (latest release version). This will start the download process.

Once downloaded, go to the `.exe` file in your **Downloads** folder, double-click and follow all the install prompts, selecting recommended options all the time.

### Step 2: Download and install RStudio {#sec-install-rstudio-windows .unnumbered}

This step requires that **Step 1** has been done and was successful.

Go to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and select the download specific for your Windows machine.

Once downloaded, double-click on `.exe` file downloaded to your **Downloads** folder and then follow all install prompts, always selecting recommended options.

### Step 3: Download and install `Rtools` {#sec-install-rtools .unnumbered}

For the things that you will be taught in the **Open and Reproducibile Science** sub-module, you we will need to expand the installation of R by installing the `Rtools` software.

Go to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and choose to download the latest version of the installer (which is the Rtools version compatible with the R version you have installed in Step 1).

Once you have downloaded the `.exe` file, double-click on the `.exe` file and follow all install prompts. Choose all the recommended options.

### Step 4: Download and install Git for Windows {#sec-install-git-windows .unnumbered}

For the things that you will be taught in the **Open and Reproducibile Science** sub-module, you we will need to install **Git for Windows**.

Go to this link - [https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest) - to download the latest version of git. Make sure to select the version compatible with your Windows machine (64-bit or 32-bit).

Once you have downloaded the `.exe` file, double-click it and then follow all install prompts. Choose all recommended options.

## macOS {#setup-macos}

### Step 1: Download and install R {#sec-install-r-macos .unnumbered}

Important that R is installed first. R is the main software and is needed for RStudio to work properly. R should always be installed first.

Go to [https://cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) and click on the link that says ***Download R for macOS***. In the following page, you will have two choices of R versions to install. Make sure to install the appropriate version for your macOS version (Apple Silicon vs Apple Intel version). Click on the download link for your macOS version. This will start the download process of the `.pkg` file specific for installing in macOS computers.

Once downloaded, go to the `.pkg` file in your `Downloads` folder, double-click and follow all the install prompts, selecting recommended options all the time.

### Install RStudio {#sec-install-rstudio-macos}

This step requires that **Step 1** has been done and was successful.

Go to [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and select the download specific for your macOS machine.

Once downloaded, double-click on `.dmg` file downloaded to your `Downloads` folder and then follow all install prompts, always selecting recommended options.

### Install git for macOS {#sec-install-git-macos}

For the things that you will be taught in the **Open and Reproducibile Science** sub-module, you we will need to install **git for macOS**. Apple machines are already pre-installed with `git` but it is usually an Apple specific version of git and tends to be older and not configured in the way we need it. So we need to install another version of it that comes with Apple's `Xcode command line tools`.

To install, go to the macOS terminal and type the following command:

```Bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Register a GitHub account {#sec-github-account}

For the **Open and Reproducible Science in R** sub-module, you will need a GitHub account to be able to receive the code materials and assignments that will be provided. This is the mechanism by which these materials will be distributed. Hence you will need to register an account with GitHub (if you don't already have one). It's free!

### Step 1. Head to [https://github.com](https://github.com) {.unnumbered}

### Step 2. Sign-up to GitHub  {.unnumbered}

On the upper right hand corner of the page, click on ***Sign-up*** button

![](images/github_account1.png)

You will be then prompted to provide an email address to register your account with.

![](images/github_account2.png)

::: {.callout-note}
With regard to the email address to use for creating a GitHub account, best practice is to use an email address that you will have access to all the time. Email addresses such as those for school (if you are a student) or for your current work may not always be the best email address to use as these email addresses tend to be time-limited (i.e., you lose the email address once you graduate or once you leave your current work).

You will then be prompted for a password

Then follow all other prompts after this including confirmation of your email and creating a GitHub username (see next step).

### Step 3. Set a GitHub username {.unnumbered}

With regard to creating/selecting a GitHub username, following are some best practice recommendations [@jenny_bryan_happy_nodate].

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tips for selecting GitHub username
* Incorporate your actual name as this lets people know who they’re dealing with and also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

* Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.

* Pick a username that will be appropriate revealing to a future boss.

* Shorter is better than longer.

* Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.

* Make it timeless and context-agnostic. Don’t add a date or year or a reference to your current location, university, or employer.

* Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen (-).

### Step 4. Setup two-factor authentication (2FA) {.unnumbered}

It is important to keep your GitHub account secure. Any breach in security of your online accounts, including GitHub, not only affects you but also those that you collaborate with. To increase the security of your GitHub account, please enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your account. This can be done [here](https://github.com/settings/security). There are 4 options for 2FA in GitHub. We recommended enabling at least 2 of these options. If you are familiar with use of passkeys, we recommend using this authentication approach in addition to 2FA.

### Step 5. Get added to the Oxford IHTM CodeHub {.unnumbered}

The Oxford IHTM CodeHub is the organisational GitHub account for the MSc IHTM. To be included in the organisation, share your GitHub username to the sub-module lead who will then add you to the organisation. This is an important step as assignments and exercises for the sub-module are distributed through GitHub and GitHub Classroom via this organisational account.

::: {.callout-important}
The Oxford IHTM CodeHub organisational GitHub account requires members to have 2FA activated. It is therefore imperative that you enable 2FA on your account to be included in the organisation.
